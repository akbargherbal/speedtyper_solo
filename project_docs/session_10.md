# Session 10 Summary: Phase 4 Continued - TikTok Banner Removed & Scrolling Investigation

**Date:** October 28, 2025
**Duration:** ~30 minutes
**Current Status:** Phase 4 - 92% COMPLETE! ✅ TikTok banner removed, remaining UI cleanup identified.

---

## Session Context: Final UI Polish for Solo Mode

This session focused on completing Phase 4 by addressing the remaining multiplayer UI elements that were still visible despite the CSS rules added in Session 9. We successfully identified and removed the TikTok social media banner and began investigating the smooth scrolling issue for long code snippets.

---

## What We Accomplished This Session

### ✅ TikTok Banner Successfully Removed

**Problem Identified:**
The TikTok promotional banner ("create & watch #speedtyperdev TikToks") was hardcoded directly in `_app.tsx` and couldn't be hidden with CSS alone. This banner appeared at the bottom of the screen and was completely irrelevant for a solo typing practice tool.

**Solution Implemented:**
We removed the entire TikTok banner section from `_app.tsx`, including:

- The banner div with FontAwesome TikTok icon
- Unused imports (`FontAwesomeIcon`, `faTiktok`, `useIsPlaying`, `IconProp`)
- Updated page title from "SpeedTyper.dev" to "SpeedTyper Solo"
- Updated meta descriptions to reflect solo mode purpose
- Removed external analytics script (optional - can be restored if needed)

**Result:** The application now has a cleaner, more focused interface without social media distractions.

### 🔍 UI Audit Completed

**Elements Still Needing Attention:**

1. **"Login | Signup"** link in bottom right corner - Location not yet determined, needs file search
2. **"invite"** button - May already be hidden by CSS, needs verification after testing
3. **User avatar/profile button** - Visibility status unclear

**Elements Confirmed Hidden by CSS:**

- Battle matcher
- GitHub login buttons
- Share/copy link buttons
- Player count indicators

### 📋 Scrolling Issue Investigation Started

**Problem:** Long code snippets don't scroll smoothly - the viewport feels "jumpy" as you type down the file.

**Investigation Progress:**

- Reviewed `CodeArea.tsx` - Has fixed height with overflow
- Reviewed `CodeTypingContainer.tsx` - Understands the component hierarchy
- Identified need to check `NextChar.tsx` and `TypedChars.tsx` to understand active line tracking

**Next Steps for Scrolling Fix:**

- Determine how the current typing position is tracked
- Implement `scrollIntoView` with smooth behavior
- Target the active character/line to keep it centered in viewport

## Next Session Action Plan: Complete Phase 4 & Start Phase 5

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours

### Priority 1: Find and Hide "Login | Signup" Links (20-30 min)

**Step 1: Search for the Login Links**

```bash
cd ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/packages/webapp-next
grep -r "Login" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" . | grep -i signup
```

**Step 2: Find Correct Layout/Navbar Paths**

```bash
find ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/packages/webapp-next -name "Layout.tsx"
find ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/packages/webapp-next -name "*avbar*.tsx"
```

**Step 3: Hide the Elements**

- Option A: Comment out in the component file
- Option B: Add more specific CSS selectors

### Priority 2: Apply CSS Updates (5 min)

**Step 1: Update globals.css**

```bash
code ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/packages/webapp-next/styles/globals.css
```

Apply the simplified SOLO MODE CSS section provided in this session.

### Priority 3: Test All UI Changes (15 min)

**Step 1: Start the Application**

```bash
cd ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo
npm run dev
```

**Step 2: Visual Verification Checklist**

- [ ] TikTok banner is gone ✅
- [ ] "Login | Signup" links are hidden
- [ ] "invite" button is hidden
- [ ] No multiplayer UI elements visible
- [ ] Profile/avatar button handled appropriately
- [ ] App still functions (can type snippets)

### Priority 4: Fix Smooth Scrolling (45-60 min)

**Step 1: Understand Current Line Tracking**

```bash
cat ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/packages/webapp-next/modules/play2/components/NextChar.tsx
cat ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/packages/webapp-next/modules/play2/components/TypedChars.tsx
```

**Step 2: Implement Smooth Scroll Solution**

Two possible approaches:

1. **Track active character position** - Use `useEffect` to watch the typing index and scroll to keep it centered
2. **Add scroll behavior to CodeArea** - Implement auto-scroll when the next character moves outside the viewport

**Likely Implementation:**

```typescript
// In CodeArea.tsx or CodeTypingContainer.tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const nextChar = document.querySelector('[data-next-char="true"]');
  if (nextChar && containerRef.current) {
    nextChar.scrollIntoView({
      behavior: "smooth",
      block: "center",
      inline: "nearest",
    });
  }
}, [index]); // Trigger on typing progress
```

**Step 3: Test with Long Snippets**

- Load a snippet >20 lines
- Type through it
- Verify smooth, centered scrolling
- Adjust timing/behavior if needed

### Priority 5: Phase 4 Completion Documentation (10 min)

Once all UI elements are hidden and scrolling is smooth:

- ✅ Update project status to Phase 4: 100% COMPLETE
- ✅ Take screenshots of clean UI
- ✅ Update TESTING.md checklist

---

## Success Criteria for Next Session

### Must Complete (Phase 4):

- ✅ All multiplayer UI elements completely hidden
- ✅ No "Login | Signup" visible
- ✅ TikTok banner removed (done this session!)
- ✅ Smooth scrolling works for long snippets
- ✅ Phase 4 officially 100% complete

### Should Complete (Phase 5 Start):

- ✅ Comment out GitHub OAuth routes in backend
- ✅ Verify guest user system handles everything
- ✅ Test: Can practice immediately without any auth

### Nice to Have:

- ✅ Create a "Quick Start" one-pager
- ✅ Document all hidden UI elements
- ✅ Add a reset script for clean slate testing

---

## Known Issues to Address Next Session

### High Priority:

1. **"Login | Signup" links still visible** - Need to locate and hide
2. **Scrolling feels awkward on long snippets** - Need smooth scroll implementation

### Medium Priority:

3. **Verify "invite" button is actually hidden** - May need testing
4. **Check if profile/avatar button needs attention** - Depends on guest user implementation

### Low Priority:

5. **Leaderboard visibility** - Decision needed: keep or hide?

---

## Code Blocks Ready for Next Session

### 1. Simplified CSS for globals.css (Ready to Apply)

```css
/* ============================================
   SOLO MODE: Hide Multiplayer UI Elements
   ============================================ */

/* Hide ALL authentication elements */
button[aria-label*="Login"],
button[aria-label*="login"],
a[href*="github/login"],
a[href*="login"],
a[href*="signup"],
.github-login-button {
  display: none !important;
}

/* Hide battle/multiplayer features */
[data-testid="battle-matcher"],
.battle-matcher,
button[aria-label*="Battle"],
button[aria-label*="Multiplayer"] {
  display: none !important;
}

/* Hide invite/share buttons */
button[aria-label*="Invite"],
button[aria-label*="Share"],
button[aria-label*="Copy link"] {
  display: none !important;
}

/* Hide multiplayer status indicators */
.player-count,
.waiting-for-players,
[data-testid="race-members"] {
  display: none !important;
}

/* Hide user profile button if it requires login */
.user-avatar:not(.guest-avatar),
button[aria-label*="Profile"] {
  display: none !important;
}
```

### 2. Enhanced CodeArea.tsx with Smooth Scrolling (Needs Active Line Detection)

Prepared but waiting for understanding of how `NextChar` marks the active position. Will finalize in next session.

---

**End of Session 10**

**Great progress!** We've eliminated the most visible multiplayer element (TikTok banner) and identified the remaining UI cleanup needed. The scrolling investigation is underway. Next session should complete Phase 4 entirely and move into Phase 5 (Auth Simplification).

---

**IMPORTANT**: THIS PROTOCOL IS PERMANENT IN ALL SESSION SUMMARIES - DO NOT REMOVE!

## 🤝 Updated Collaboration Protocol (Minimum Friction)

### Command Patterns We're Using:

**When I (Claude) need to see a file:**

```bash
cat ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/path/to/file
```

You copy-paste the output back to me.

**When I (Claude) need to see specific lines:**

```bash
cat ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/path/to/file | grep -A 20 "searchTerm"
```

**When you need to edit a file:**

```bash
code ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/path/to/file
```

I provide the full code block, you copy-paste into VS Code.

**When testing:**

```bash
cd ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo
npm run dev
```

**When checking database:**

```bash
cd ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/packages/back-nest
sqlite3 speedtyper-local.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM challenge WHERE id LIKE 'local-%';"
```

**When searching for files/content:**

```bash
find ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo -name "filename"
grep -r "searchterm" --include="*.tsx" ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/
```

### Key Principles:

1. ✅ **Always use full absolute paths** from home directory
2. ✅ **I provide `code` commands**, not `nano` (you prefer VS Code)
3. ✅ **I give you full code blocks to copy-paste**, not diffs
4. ✅ **You only upload specific files** when I ask (not entire codebase)
5. ✅ **Terminal-based workflow** (cat, grep, code, npm) - fast and efficient
