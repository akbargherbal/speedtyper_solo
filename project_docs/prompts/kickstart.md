This is our 19th session I believe — We're cotinuing where we left off in our last session.

```
CONTEXT <--
```

I’ll share with you the key documents for this project:

1. Project Overview — `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`
2. Features to be implemented in the next phase of the projet — `FEATURES.md`
3. Project Architecture/Stack: `ARCHITECTURE.md`
4. Last session summary: `session_18.md`

   Due to token limits per session, I can’t upload the entire codebase. However, if you suspect there’s an issue with a file or need to verify something, please ALWAYS ASK for the specific files you need. Don’t make guesses or assumptions.
