# Session 24 Summary: Critical Bug Fix - Blank Screen on Empty Language

**Date:** October 31, 2025
**Duration:** ~25 minutes
**Current Status:** Tier 1 Feature "Backend Crash Resilience" - 100% Complete

---

## What We Accomplished This Session

- **Diagnosed Blank Screen Bug:** We successfully identified the root cause of the blank screen issue. The frontend was requesting snippets for a language (Python) that had no entries in the database, and the backend's error message was not being handled by the client.
- **Implemented Frontend Error Handling:** We implemented a robust fix by adding a new WebSocket event listener (`listenForRaceError`) to the frontend game service (`Game.ts`).
- **Provided User-Friendly Feedback:** The application now catches the "No challenges found" error and displays a clear, actionable alert to the user (e.g., "No snippets found for Python. Add code..."), preventing user confusion.
- **Updated Project Documentation:** We updated `FEATURES.md` to reflect that the "Backend Crash Resilience" task is now complete, keeping our project plan synchronized with the codebase.

## Files Modified This Session

### 1. `packages/webapp-next/modules/play2/services/Game.ts`

**Path:** `~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/packages/webapp-next/modules/play2/services/Game.ts`

**Changes:**

- Added a call to `this.listenForRaceError()` in the `onConnect` method to register the new event listener.
- Implemented the new private method `listenForRaceError()` which subscribes to the `race_error` WebSocket event and displays an alert with a helpful message.

**Status:** COMPLETE

### 2. `docs/FEATURES.md`

**Path:** `~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/docs/FEATURES.md`

**Changes:**

- Updated the "Backend Crash Resilience" feature status from `NEW` to `COMPLETED`.
- Added a detailed description of the fix, implementation time, and files modified.

**Status:** COMPLETE

## Files Reviewed This Session

- `packages/back-nest/src/races/race.gateway.ts`
- `packages/webapp-next/modules/play2/state/settings-store.ts`

## Current Blockers

None. The critical bug is resolved, and the application is stable.

---

## Next Session Action Plan

**Priority 1:** Begin implementation of configurable keyboard shortcuts.

**Files to review:**

```bash
cat ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/packages/webapp-next/hooks/useKeyMap.ts
cat ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/packages/webapp-next/modules/play2/components/CodeArea.tsx
```

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] `useKeyMap.ts` is refactored to support modifier keys (e.g., `Ctrl`).
- [ ] `Enter` key can start a new race from the results page.
- [ ] `Ctrl + R` refreshes the current snippet without a full page reload.

## ü§ù Collaboration Protocol (Minimum Friction)

### Command Patterns We're Using:

**When I (Claude) need to see a file:**

```bash
cat ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/path/to/file
```

You copy-paste the output back to me.

**When I (Claude) need to see specific lines:**

```bash
cat ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/path/to/file | grep -A 20 "searchTerm"
```

**When you need to edit a file:**

```bash
code ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/path/to/file
```

I provide the full code block, you copy-paste into VS Code.

**When testing:**

```bash
cd ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo
npm run dev
```

**When checking database:**

```bash
cd ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/packages/back-nest
sqlite3 speedtyper-local.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM challenge WHERE id LIKE 'local-%';"
```

**When searching for files/content:**

```bash
find ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo -name "filename"
grep -r "searchterm" --include="*.tsx" ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/
```

**When checking line endings or hidden characters:**

```bash
head -1 file.js | od -c              # Show character codes
file file.js                          # Check file encoding
hexdump -C file.js | head -3         # Show hex dump
```

### Key Principles:

1.  ‚úÖ **Always use full absolute paths** from home directory
2.  ‚úÖ **I provide `code` commands**, not `nano` (you prefer VS Code)
3.  ‚úÖ **I give you full code blocks to copy-paste**, not diffs
4.  ‚úÖ **You only upload specific files** when I ask (not entire codebase)
5.  ‚úÖ **Terminal-based workflow** (cat, grep, code, npm) - fast and efficient
6.  ‚úÖ **Hex dumps for debugging** encoding/line ending issues
