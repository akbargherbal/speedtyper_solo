## What We Accomplished This Session

This session was a strategic planning and brainstorming session focused on defining the project's direction after the v1.3.0 release.

1.  **Assessed Project Maturity:** We confirmed the project is in a stable, mature state, making it an ideal time to plan the next major features.
2.  **Reviewed Dashboard Feature:** We analyzed the planned "User Progress Tracking Dashboard" from the existing roadmap.
3.  **Identified Critical Flaw:** The user correctly pointed out that the current ephemeral "guest user" system is inadequate for long-term progress tracking, as it creates new random users frequently.
4.  **Defined Foundational Prerequisite:** We agreed on a new, high-priority foundational task: **"Stabilize User Identity."** This involves creating a "Local Super User" model to ensure all data is tied to a single, persistent user, making any future analytics reliable.
5.  **Brainstormed New Core Features:** The user proposed three high-impact feature areas for investigation:
    - **Smart Typing Engine:** Configurable skipping of characters (e.g., spaces).
    - **Skippable AST Nodes:** Making code structures like comments and strings visible but not typable, leveraging Tree-sitter.
    - **Language-Specific Syntax Highlighting:** With the critical constraint of preserving real-time, character-by-character feedback (correct/incorrect).
6.  **Developed Investigation Plans:** We broke down each proposed feature into phased, low-risk investigative steps to "uncover unknowns" before committing to implementation. This includes backend-only spikes and frontend prototypes.
7.  **Produced a Client Brief:** As the primary deliverable for this session, I drafted a formal **"Project Brief & Request for Consultation"** document. This document synthesizes our current status, future goals, and key architectural questions, preparing us for collaboration with an independent consultant.

## Key Decisions & Outcomes

- **Implementation Paused:** We have deliberately paused the final task of v1.3.0 ("Enhanced User Feedback") to prioritize this strategic review.
- **Roadmap Revision:** The "User Progress Tracking Dashboard" is now officially dependent on the completion of the "Stabilize User Identity" task. The "Persistent Guest ID" approach has been deprecated in favor of the more robust "Local Super User" model.
- **Investigation Phase Initiated:** The next few sessions will be dedicated to investigating the three proposed feature areas to determine feasibility and chart a clear course for development post-v1.3.0.

## Documents Produced This Session

### 1. `Project Brief & Request for Consultation`

**Purpose:** A formal document outlining the project's current state, future vision, and key architectural questions. This will be used to solicit feedback from an independent consultant.
**Status:** COMPLETE

---

## Next Session Action Plan

The next session will be the start of our **Investigation Phase**.

**Priority 1: Review External Feedback & Finalize Plan**

- Review and discuss the feedback provided by the independent consultant based on the `Project Brief`.
- Synthesize the consultant's recommendations with our own plans to create a finalized, prioritized roadmap for v1.4.0 and beyond.

**Priority 2: Begin Foundational Implementation**

- **Task:** Implement the "Stabilize User Identity" feature (the "Local Super User" model).
- **Files to review:**
  ```bash
  cat ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/packages/back-nest/src/middlewares/guest-user.ts
  cat ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/packages/back-nest/src/users/services/user.service.ts
  cat ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/packages/back-nest/src/users/entities/user.entity.ts
  ```
- **Success Criteria:** After implementation, completing multiple races across application restarts must result in all `result` entries being associated with a single, unique `userId` in the database.

**Priority 3: Begin Technical Investigations (Time Permitting)**

- Begin the feasibility spikes for the new features, starting with the highest-risk items:
  1.  **Smart Typing Spike:** A backend-only test to see if `keystroke-validator.service.ts` can be modified to handle skippable spaces.
  2.  **Syntax Highlighting Spike:** A standalone frontend prototype to test the feasibility of merging a syntax highlighting library with our character-level feedback rendering.

## ü§ù Collaboration Protocol (Minimum Friction)

### Command Patterns We're Using:

**When I (Claude) need to see a file:**

```bash
cat ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/path/to/file
```

You copy-paste the output back to me.

**When I (Claude) need to see specific lines:**

```bash
cat ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/path/to/file | grep -A 20 "searchTerm"
```

**When you need to edit a file:**

```bash
code ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/path/to/file
```

I provide the full code block, you copy-paste into VS Code.

**When testing:**

```bash
cd ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo
npm run dev
```

**When checking database:**

```bash
cd ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/packages/back-nest
sqlite3 speedtyper-local.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM challenge WHERE id LIKE 'local-%';"
```

**When searching for files/content:**

```bash
find ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo -name "filename"
grep -r "searchterm" --include="*.tsx" ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/
```

**When checking line endings or hidden characters:**

```bash
head -1 file.js | od -c              # Show character codes
file file.js                          # Check file encoding
hexdump -C file.js | head -3         # Show hex dump
```

### Key Principles:

1.  ‚úÖ **Always use full absolute paths** from home directory
2.  ‚úÖ **I provide `code` commands**, not `nano` (you prefer VS Code)
3.  ‚úÖ **I give you full code blocks to copy-paste**, not diffs
4.  ‚úÖ **You only upload specific files** when I ask (not entire codebase)
5.  ‚úÖ **Terminal-based workflow** (cat, grep, code, npm) - fast and efficient
6.  ‚úÖ **Hex dumps for debugging** encoding/line ending issues
