# Session 18 Summary: Documentation Overhaul & Feature Verification

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Duration:** ~2.5 hours  
**Current Status:** v1.1.0 documentation complete, project entering mature phase.

---

## Session Context

This session focused on:

1. Fact-checking the AI-generated feature roadmap
2. Implementing the first "quick win" feature
3. Creating comprehensive v1.1.0 documentation to replace transformation-phase docs

---

## What We Accomplished This Session

### ‚úÖ Feature 1: Remove Broken UI Elements (30 minutes)

**Completed successfully:**

- Removed `LeaderboardButton` import and usage from `NewNavbar.tsx`
- Removed `TrendsWPM` and `DailyStreak` components from `ResultsContainer.tsx`
- Cleaned up empty/fake stats panels from results page

**Result:** App runs smoothly with cleaner, more honest UI that reflects solo-practice purpose.

### ‚úÖ Comprehensive Feature Report Fact-Check (60 minutes)

**Files Verified:**

- `settings-store.ts` - Language persistence system
- `useKeyMap.ts` - Keyboard shortcut infrastructure
- `race.gateway.ts` - WebSocket event handlers
- `race-events.service.ts` - Payload emission logic
- `challenge.entity.ts` - Database schema

**Key Discoveries:**

1. **Feature 3 (Language Persistence) - ALREADY IMPLEMENTED**

   - `getInitialLanguageFromLocalStorage()` exists and works
   - `setLanguage()` saves to localStorage
   - Removed from roadmap as "to-do"

2. **Feature 2 (Keyboard Shortcuts) - EFFORT UNDERSTATED**

   - Original report: "Low-to-Medium"
   - Reality: **Medium effort (4-6 hours)**
   - Current `useKeyMap.ts` does NOT support modifier keys (Ctrl, Alt, Shift)
   - Requires complete hook rewrite, not just enhancement

3. **Feature 5 (Smart Snippets) - ARCHITECTURE CLARIFIED**
   - User's instinct was correct: DB approach was wrong
   - Verified approach: Enrich WebSocket payload (no DB schema changes)
   - Backend: Parse comments, add `nonTypableRanges` field to challenge
   - Frontend: Modify typing engine to skip ranges (HIGH RISK)

### ‚úÖ Created New Documentation Suite (90 minutes)

**Four comprehensive documents created:**

1. **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md** (~3,500 words)

   - What the project is and why it exists
   - Philosophy and design principles
   - Quick start guide for new users
   - Project status and roadmap preview

2. **ARCHITECTURE.md** (~7,000 words)

   - Complete system architecture diagram
   - Tech stack breakdown (backend + frontend)
   - Detailed project structure
   - Data flow documentation (snippet import, typing workflow, WebSocket contract)
   - Database schema reference
   - Critical files list with modification risk assessment
   - Development workflow and debugging guides

3. **FEATURES.md** (~4,500 words)

   - Corrected roadmap with accurate effort estimates
   - Three-tier priority system (Tier 1: Quick wins, Tier 2: Medium priority, Tier 3: Future)
   - Detailed implementation plans for each feature
   - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
   - Feature priority matrix
   - Out-of-scope items explicitly listed

4. **README-LOCAL.md** (Updated, ~2,500 words)
   - User-facing quick-start guide
   - Daily usage workflow
   - Commands reference
   - Comprehensive troubleshooting section
   - FAQ
   - Current status and limitations

**Total documentation:** ~17,500 words of technical content

---

## Files Modified This Session

### 1. Modified: `packages/webapp-next/common/components/NewNavbar.tsx`

- **Removed:** `import { LeaderboardButton } from "..."`
- **Removed:** `<LeaderboardButton />` component usage

### 2. Modified: `packages/webapp-next/modules/play2/containers/ResultsContainer.tsx`

### 5. Created: `docs/FEATURES.md` (New)

### 6. Updated: `README-LOCAL.md` (Existing file, comprehensive rewrite)

---

## Key Insights & Decisions

### Documentation Philosophy

**New docs are designed as:**

- **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md** - Context and philosophy (read first)
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Technical reference (for developers)
- **FEATURES.md** - Living roadmap (updated as features ship)
- **README-LOCAL.md** - User quick-start (for daily use)

**Old docs (speedtyper_context.md, speedtyper_plan.md):**

- Should be archived to `docs/archive/`
- Contain valuable historical context
- No longer needed for active development

### Architecture Verification Results

**Confirmed:**

- WebSocket contract is simple (11 events)
- SQLite migration was successful
- Guest user system works perfectly
- Tree-sitter parsing is solid

**Clarified:**

- Smart Snippets = payload enrichment, NOT database schema change
- Backend sends full `Challenge` entity to frontend
- Frontend renders code character-by-character in `CodeArea.tsx`

## Questions for Next Session

### Decision Points

1. **Which feature should we implement next?**

   - Option A: Tier 1 quick wins (Error handling + Snippet metadata) - Low effort, low risk
   - Option B: Keyboard shortcuts - Medium effort, medium risk
   - Option C: Progress tracking architecture design - Research phase
   - Option D: Something else

2. **Documentation review:**

   - Are the new docs clear and useful?
   - Any missing sections or unclear explanations?
   - Should we create a CHANGELOG.md?

3. **Git workflow:**
   - Commit documentation to repo?
   - Create v1.1.0 git tag?
   - Branch strategy for new features?

**MANDATORY PROTOCOL: COLLABORATION PROTOCOL**

## ü§ù Collaboration Protocol (Minimum Friction)

### Command Patterns We're Using:

**When I (Claude) need to see a file:**

```bash
cat ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/path/to/file
```

You copy-paste the output back to me.

**When I (Claude) need to see specific lines:**

```bash
cat ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/path/to/file | grep -A 20 "searchTerm"
```

**When you need to edit a file:**

```bash
code ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/path/to/file
```

I provide the full code block, you copy-paste into VS Code.

**When testing:**

```bash
cd ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo
npm run dev
# or
npm run build
npm run start
```

**When checking database:**

```bash
cd ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/packages/back-nest
sqlite3 speedtyper-local.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM challenge WHERE id LIKE 'local-%';"
```

**When searching for files/content:**

```bash
find ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo -name "filename"
grep -r "searchterm" --include="*.tsx" ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/
```

### Key Principles:

1. ‚úÖ **Always use full absolute paths** from home directory
2. ‚úÖ **I provide `code` commands**, not `nano` (you prefer VS Code)
3. ‚úÖ **I give you full code blocks to copy-paste**, not diffs
4. ‚úÖ **You only upload specific files** when I ask (not entire codebase)
5. ‚úÖ **Terminal-based workflow** (cat, grep, code, npm) - fast and efficient
