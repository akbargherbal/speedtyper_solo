# Session 22 Summary: Designing a Pattern-Based Snippet Extractor

**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Duration:** ~90 minutes
**Current Status:** Design complete, ready for implementation.

---

## Session Context

This session was an investigation into a critical import issue: a large number of the user's LLM-generated snippet files were being skipped by the parser. We diagnosed the root cause as a fundamental mismatch between the parser's design and the user's actual use case, leading to the design of a new, more flexible extraction method.

---

## What We Accomplished This Session

### 1. Diagnosed the Core Import Problem

**Problem:** The import logs showed that 20 out of 43 files were being completely skipped, yielding 0 snippets.

**Investigation & Discovery:**

- The existing tree-sitter parser was designed to extract production-like code (functions, classes).
- The user's files, generated for "pattern memorization," consisted of standalone code blocks (`expression_statement`) which were being filtered out by the parser's strict whitelist.

**Key Insight:** This was an **architectural mismatch**. The parser expected "reusable code," but the user needed "learning examples."

### 2. Designed a New Marker-Based Extraction System

**Solutions Considered:**

- ‚ùå **Modifying Tree-Sitter:** Deemed too risky, as it could lead to importing low-quality, single-line code fragments.
- ‚úÖ **Comment Markers:** A new system using `// PATTERN:` markers was chosen. This approach is explicit, safe, and doesn't break the existing tree-sitter logic for other files.

**Design Details:**

- **Hybrid Approach:** The `parser.service.ts` would first check for `// PATTERN:` markers. If found, it would use a new block extraction mode. If not, it would fall back to the existing tree-sitter mode.
- **New Methods Planned:**
  - `extractPatternBlocks()`: To split the file by markers and extract code.
  - `isValidPatternBlock()`: To validate extracted blocks against the filters in `parser.config.json`.
- **New File Format Defined:** A clear specification for using `// PATTERN: {Description}` was created.

---

## Files To Be Modified (Design Phase)

### 1. `packages/back-nest/src/challenges/services/parser.service.ts`

- **Plan:** Enhance `parseTrackedNodes()` and add the new `extractPatternBlocks()` and `isValidPatternBlock()` methods to implement the hybrid parsing logic.

---

## Testing & Verification Plan

- **User Action:** The user was to test the implementation offline (which, as we learned in Session 23, had not yet been committed).
- **Test File:** A new file, `snippets/javascript/013_string-methods.js`, was created with 9 distinct patterns using the new marker format.
- **Expected Outcome:** Running `npm run reimport` should detect the markers and successfully import all 9 valid snippets from the test file.

---

## Key Insights & Decisions

### Clarify the Use Case Before Building the Solution

- The core breakthrough was understanding the user's goal: **pattern memorization**, not typing production code. This insight directly led to abandoning the tree-sitter-only approach and designing a more appropriate solution.

### Explicit is Better Than Implicit

- We chose an explicit marker system (`// PATTERN:`) over trying to implicitly guess code blocks with tree-sitter. This makes the parsing process more predictable, robust, and user-driven.

### Maintain Backward Compatibility

- The hybrid design ensures that the new feature is a non-breaking change. All existing snippet files that worked with the tree-sitter parser will continue to work without any modification.

## Project Status After Session 22

**Current Version:** v1.2.0 (unchanged)
**Stability:** ‚úÖ Excellent. No code was changed; this was a design session.
**Documentation:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Will need updates to document the new `// PATTERN:` format after implementation and testing.

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1.  **Implement the Design:** Apply the planned changes to `parser.service.ts`.
2.  **Test the Implementation:** Run `npm run reimport` and verify that the test file (`013_string-methods.js`) imports correctly.
3.  **Update Snippet Files:** If the test succeeds, add `// PATTERN:` markers to the 20 files that were previously being skipped.
4.  **Update LLM Prompts:** Modify the user's LLM prompts to automatically generate code with the new marker format.

---

## Questions for Next Session

1.  Did the pattern extraction implementation work as expected?
2.  Please share the output from the `npm run reimport` command.
3.  Are the extracted snippets of good quality for typing practice?

---

## Statistics

**Total Sessions:** 22
**Lines of Code Modified:** ~120 lines (Designed, but not yet implemented)
**New Methods Designed:** 2 (`extractPatternBlocks`, `isValidPatternBlock`)
**Methods to be Enhanced:** 1 (`parseTrackedNodes`)

---

**End of Session 22**

A new, robust system for extracting pattern-based snippets was designed to solve a critical import failure. This design respects the user's primary workflow and sets the stage for a significant increase in the number of available practice snippets.

## ü§ù Collaboration Protocol (Minimum Friction)

### Command Patterns We're Using:

**When I (Claude) need to see a file:**

```bash
cat ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/path/to/file
```

You copy-paste the output back to me.

**When I (Claude) need to see specific lines:**

```bash
cat ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/path/to/file | grep -A 20 "searchTerm"
```

**When you need to edit a file:**

```bash
code ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/path/to/file
```

I provide the full code block, you copy-paste into VS Code.

**When testing:**

```bash
cd ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo
npm run dev
```

**When checking database:**

```bash
cd ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/packages/back-nest
sqlite3 speedtyper-local.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM challenge WHERE id LIKE 'local-%';"
```

**When searching for files/content:**

```bash
find ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo -name "filename"
grep -r "searchterm" --include="*.tsx" ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/
```

### Key Principles:

1.  ‚úÖ **Always use full absolute paths** from home directory
2.  ‚úÖ **I provide `code` commands**, not `nano` (you prefer VS Code)
3.  ‚úÖ **I give you full code blocks to copy-paste**, not diffs
4.  ‚úÖ **You only upload specific files** when I ask (not entire codebase)
5.  ‚úÖ **Terminal-based workflow** (cat, grep, code, npm) - fast and efficient
