# Session 6 Summary: Speedtyper Local Progress

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Duration:** ~1 hour  
**Current Status:** Phase 3 - COMPLETE! ‚úÖ All 30 snippets imported successfully, typing flow verified working

---

## What We Accomplished This Session

### ‚úÖ SOLVED THE BLOCKER: Tree-Sitter Filter Issues

**Problem from Session 5:**
- Only 2 out of 30 files imported due to strict tree-sitter filters
- Filters were rejecting snippets (MAX_NODE_LENGTH=300, MAX_NUM_LINES=11, MAX_LINE_LENGTH=55)
- Missing node types for JavaScript/TypeScript (`lexical_declaration`)
- No `.tsx` parser mapping

**Solution Implemented:** **Option B - Whole-File Import**
- Modified `local-import-runner.ts` to skip tree-sitter parsing entirely
- Import entire file as single challenge (no extraction, no filtering)
- Better for practice: Complete, coherent code examples vs extracted functions
- Simpler implementation, faster to ship

---

### ‚úÖ Key Changes Made to `local-import-runner.ts`

**What Changed:**

1. **Removed tree-sitter dependency**
   - Deleted `ParserService` injection
   - Removed `parser.parseTrackedNodes()` calls
   - Direct file-to-challenge conversion

2. **Fixed URL collision issue**
   - Changed from timestamp-based IDs to content hash
   - Used `crypto.createHash('sha256')` for stable, unique IDs
   - Format: `local-<16-char-hash>` based on file path + content

3. **Confirmed `.tsx` mapping**
   - Already had `'tsx': 'typescript'` in language map
   - No issues with React/TypeScript files

4. **Improved logging**
   - Shows line count per file instead of "snippets extracted"
   - Clear progress: `1/30 - javascript/01-async-fetch.js ‚Üí 15 lines imported`

---

### ‚úÖ Import Success: All 30 Snippets Working!

**Import Results:**
```

- ‚úÖ 3.9: Database verification - **30 snippets imported** (Session 6 - THIS SESSION!)
- ‚úÖ 3.10: Test in UI - **Verified working** (Session 6 - THIS SESSION!)
- ‚úÖ 3.11: Iterate on snippet quality - **Deferred to Phase 6** (cosmetic fixes)

**Phase 3 officially complete!** üéâ

## ‚ö†Ô∏è UI Issues Discovered (Not Blockers, Document for Later)

During UI testing, identified **2 UX issues** that need fixing in Phase 4 or 6:

### Issue #1: Can't Choose Language/Snippet
**Current Behavior:**
- User is presented with random snippet in random language
- Cursor auto-placed on first character
- No way to select specific language or file

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Language selector UI **already exists** (`LanguageSelector.tsx`)
- Fully functional: Fetches languages from `/api/languages`, calls `game?.next()` on selection
- **Hidden behind multiplayer logic**: `{isOwner && <LanguageSelector />}` in `RaceSettings.tsx`
- In solo mode, guest user is not considered "owner" so selector doesn't appear

**Files Involved:**
- `packages/webapp-next/modules/play2/components/RaceSettings.tsx` (Line 36: `{isOwner && <LanguageSelector />}`)
- `packages/webapp-next/modules/play2/components/race-settings/LanguageSelector.tsx` (fully functional component)
- `packages/webapp-next/modules/play2/state/game-store.ts` (defines `isOwner` logic - needs investigation)

**Proposed Fix:**
- Make guest user always "owner" in solo mode
- Or remove `isOwner` gate entirely for language selector
- Requires modifying `game-store.ts` ownership logic

---

### Issue #2: Viewport Scrolling Problem
**Current Behavior:**
- For snippets >10 lines, typing causes code to scroll to bottom of page
- User must manually scroll (mouse or keyboard) to center code
- After scrolling, first keystroke causes it to scroll back to bottom
- Disruptive typing experience for longer snippets

**Root Cause Hypothesis:**
- Original speedtyper.dev designed for tree-sitter filtered snippets (max 11 lines)
- Viewport/caret tracking logic assumes short snippets
- Doesn't auto-scroll smoothly to keep active line visible
- Likely in `CodeArea.tsx` or caret tracking components

**Files to Investigate:**
- `packages/webapp-next/modules/play2/components/CodeArea.tsx` (viewport/scroll logic)
- `packages/webapp-next/modules/play2/components/SmoothCaret.tsx` (caret positioning)
- Possibly CSS scroll behavior in typing container

**Proposed Fix:**
- Add smooth scroll-into-view for active line
- Adjust viewport tracking to keep cursor centered
- May need `element.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'center' })`

## Files Modified This Session

### 1. Modified: `packages/back-nest/src/challenges/commands/local-import-runner.ts`
**Changes:**
- Removed `ParserService` dependency
- Removed tree-sitter parsing logic
- Implemented whole-file import strategy
- Fixed URL collision with content hashing
- Improved logging output

**Key Code Changes:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (Session 5):
const parser = this.parserService.getParser(file.extension);
const nodes = parser.parseTrackedNodes(content);
// Created multiple challenges per file

// AFTER (Session 6):
const content = fs.readFileSync(file.absolutePath, 'utf-8');
const contentHash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(...).digest('hex');
// Creates single challenge per file
```

---

## Quick Verification Commands

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo

# Check imported snippets
cd packages/back-nest
sqlite3 speedtyper-local.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM challenge WHERE id LIKE 'local-%';"
# Expected: 30

# View sample snippets
sqlite3 speedtyper-local.db "SELECT id, language, path, LENGTH(content) as chars FROM challenge WHERE id LIKE 'local-%' LIMIT 5;"

# Start app
cd ../..
npm run dev
# Browser opens to localhost:3001
# Start typing!
```

---

## Next Session Action Plan: Phase 4 - Multiplayer Removal & UI Fixes

### **Session Goal:** Make speedtyper.dev truly solo

**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours for Phase 4 core work

---

### **Priority 1: Fix Language Selection (1-2 hours)**

This directly addresses user's Issue #1 and is part of multiplayer cleanup.

**Step 1: Investigate Ownership Logic (30 min)**
```bash
cd ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/packages/webapp-next

# Check how isOwner is determined
cat modules/play2/state/game-store.ts | grep -A 20 "isOwner"

# Or get full file
cat modules/play2/state/game-store.ts
```

**Step 2: Make Guest User Always Owner (30 min)**
- Modify `game-store.ts` to return `isOwner: true` for solo mode
- OR remove `isOwner` gate in `RaceSettings.tsx` entirely

**Step 3: Test Language Selection (30 min)**
- Start app
- Click language selector (should now be visible)
- Select "Python"
- Verify new Python snippet loads
- Select "JavaScript"
- Verify new JS snippet loads
- Click "clear" ‚Üí verify random language returns

---

### **Priority 2: Backend Multiplayer Removal (1-2 hours)**

**Step 1: Study Race Gateway (30 min)**
```bash
cd ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/packages/back-nest

# Main WebSocket handler file
cat src/races/race.gateway.ts
```

Identify:
- Which handlers use `server.to(roomId).emit()` (broadcasting)
- Which handlers use `socket.emit()` (single socket)
- Room join/leave logic

**Step 2: Stub Broadcasting Logic (60 min)**

Modify `src/races/race.gateway.ts`:
```typescript
// BEFORE (multiplayer):
server.to(raceId).emit('progress_updated', allPlayersData);

// AFTER (solo):
socket.emit('progress_updated', currentPlayerData);

// BEFORE (multiplayer):
socket.join(raceId);

// AFTER (solo):
// Remove or comment out
```

**Key Handlers to Modify:**
- `onPlay()` - Remove room join
- `onJoin()` - Simplify to single player
- `onKeyStroke()` - Remove broadcast
- `onStartRace()` - Remove countdown coordination

**Step 3: Test Backend Changes (30 min)**
```bash
npm run start:dev
# Verify no TypeScript errors
# Check console for WebSocket connection messages
```

---

### **Priority 3: Hide Multiplayer UI Elements (30-60 min)**

**Option A: CSS-Only (Quick, 15 min)**

Add to `packages/webapp-next/styles/globals.css`:
```css
/* Hide multiplayer/auth UI elements */
.github-login-button,
[data-testid="battle-matcher"],
.leaderboard-link,
.profile-button,
nav .social-links,
button:has-text("invite"),
button:has-text("Login"),
[href*="github"] {
  display: none !important;
}
```

Use browser inspector (F12) to find additional selectors.

**Option B: Component-Level (Better, 45 min)**

Find and comment out/modify:
- `packages/webapp-next/common/components/buttons/GithubLoginButton.tsx`
- `packages/webapp-next/common/components/BattleMatcher.tsx`
- `packages/webapp-next/common/components/NewNavbar.tsx` (social links)

**Step: Verify UI Cleanup**
- Start app
- Check: No GitHub login button
- Check: No battle matcher
- Check: No invite button
- Check: No profile/social links

---

### **If Time Permits: Start Viewport Scroll Fix (1-2 hours)**

This addresses user's Issue #2.

**Step 1: Study Code Area Component (30 min)**
```bash
cd ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/packages/webapp-next

cat modules/play2/components/CodeArea.tsx
cat modules/play2/components/SmoothCaret.tsx
```

**Step 2: Add Smooth Scroll Behavior (60 min)**

Likely need to add in `CodeArea.tsx` or wherever active line is rendered:
```typescript
// When active line changes
useEffect(() => {
  activeLineRef.current?.scrollIntoView({
    behavior: 'smooth',
    block: 'center',  // Keep line centered
    inline: 'nearest'
  });
}, [currentLineIndex]);
```

**Step 3: Test Scroll Behavior (30 min)**
- Type a 20-line snippet
- Verify: Screen auto-centers on active line
- Verify: No jarring jumps to bottom
- Verify: Smooth scrolling experience
