# Session 21 Summary: Configurable Snippet Filters

**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Duration:** ~75 minutes
**Current Status:** Feature complete. Project version is now v1.2.0.

---

## Session Context

This session focused on implementing "Path A" from our previous plan: the low-risk, high-value feature of configurable snippet filters. The goal was to replace hardcoded filter values in the backend with a user-editable JSON configuration file, making the snippet import process more flexible and transparent.

---

## What We Accomplished This Session

### ‚úÖ Feature: Configurable Snippet Filters

**Problem Identified:**

- Snippet quality filters (min/max length, line count) were hardcoded in `parser.service.ts`.
- Customizing snippet quality required direct code modification, which is inconvenient and risky.
- The import summary log displayed outdated, hardcoded filter values.

**Solution Implemented:**

1.  **Created `parser.config.json`:**

    - A new, user-facing JSON file was added to `packages/back-nest/` to control all filter settings.
    - Includes defaults, comments, and placeholders for future parsing features.

2.  **Refactored `parser.service.ts`:**

    - The service now loads `parser.config.json` upon initialization.
    - It includes robust validation to check for invalid values (e.g., `min > max`) and gracefully falls back to safe defaults if the config is missing, malformed, or invalid.
    - All hardcoded filter values were replaced with values from the loaded config.

3.  **Fixed Dynamic Logging in `local-import-runner.ts`:**

    - The import runner script was refactored to also read the `parser.config.json`.
    - The final summary report now dynamically displays the currently active filter values, ensuring the "Tip" message is always accurate.

4.  **Updated All Documentation:**
    - `README.md` was updated to version 1.2.0, with the new feature added to the completed list and a detailed "Customization" section explaining how to use `parser.config.json`.
    - `ARCHITECTURE.md` was updated to document the new configuration file's location, structure, and loading behavior.

**Result:**

- Users can now easily tune snippet quality to match their practice goals without touching any source code.
- The application is more robust, with safe fallbacks for invalid configurations.
- The import process is more transparent, with accurate logging.
- All project documentation is current and reflects the new capabilities.

## Files Modified This Session

### 1. Created: `packages/back-nest/parser.config.json`

- **Added:** The new user-facing configuration file with default filter values.

### 2. Created: `packages/back-nest/src/challenges/services/parser-config.interface.ts`

- **Added:** A TypeScript interface for the config structure to ensure type safety and provide default values.

### 3. Modified: `packages/back-nest/src/challenges/services/parser.service.ts`

### 4. Modified: `packages/back-nest/src/challenges/commands/local-import-runner.ts`

- **Fixed:** Refactored to load the config and display dynamic, accurate filter values in the final import summary.

### 5. Modified: `README.md`

- **Updated:** Version number, feature lists, and added a comprehensive section on how to customize snippet filters.

### 6. Modified: `ARCHITECTURE.md`

- **Updated:** Rewrote the "Modifying Snippet Filtering" section and added a new "Configuration Files" section.

## Testing & Verification

**Test Scenario 1: Custom Config**

- Set stricter filters in `parser.config.json` and ran `npm run reimport`.
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Logs confirmed the stricter, custom values were loaded and used, resulting in fewer snippets being imported.

**Test Scenario 2: Invalid Config**

- Set `minNodeLength > maxNodeLength` in the config and ran `npm run reimport`.
- **Result:** ‚úÖ The parser correctly identified the invalid config, logged a warning, and gracefully fell back to the safe default values, allowing the import to succeed.

**Test Scenario 3: Logging Fix Verification**

- Ran `npm run reimport` with the fixed runner script and custom config.
- **Result:** ‚úÖ The summary "Tip" message correctly displayed the dynamic filter values (e.g., "150-500 characters, max 15 lines"), confirming the bug was fixed.

## Project Status After Session 21

**Current Version:** v1.2.0
**Stability:** ‚úÖ Excellent - Core features are stable and the new configuration system includes robust error handling.
**Documentation:** ‚úÖ Fully up-to-date and comprehensive.
**Next Milestone:** v1.3.0 (Medium-priority features)

---

## Recommended Next Steps

With the low-risk wins from v1.2.0 complete, the codebase is in a great position to tackle a higher-impact feature.

### **Priority 1: Keyboard Shortcuts**

- **Effort:** 4-6 hours
- **Risk:** üü° Medium
- **Value:** Very High
- **Why:** This is the most significant quality-of-life improvement remaining on the roadmap before the much larger Progress Dashboard feature. It directly enhances the core typing workflow.

## Git Status After Session

**Changes Committed:**

- Created: `parser.config.json`
- Created: `parser-config.interface.ts`
- Modified: `parser.service.ts`
- Modified: `local-import-runner.ts`
- Modified: `README.md`
- Modified: `ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Commit Message:**

```
feat(v1.2.0): implement configurable snippet filters

- Add parser.config.json to allow user customization of snippet quality filters (min/max length, line count, etc.).
- Refactor ParserService to load, validate, and use the new config file, with a graceful fallback to defaults.
- Update LocalImportRunner to read the config, ensuring its summary log is always accurate.
- Update README.md and ARCHITECTURE.md to fully document the new feature and usage.
```

## Questions for Next Session

1.  **Are we ready to proceed with the Keyboard Shortcuts feature?** It's the next logical step and a high-impact win.
2.  **Do you have a 3-4 hour block available for the next session?** This would be ideal for making significant progress on the `useKeyMap.ts` rewrite.

**MANDATORY PROTOCOL: ALWAYS INCLUDE THIS SECTION VERBATIM AT THE END OF EVERY SESSION SUMMARY.**

## ü§ù Collaboration Protocol (Minimum Friction)

### Command Patterns We're Using:

**When I (Claude) need to see a file:**

```bash
cat ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/path/to/file
```

You copy-paste the output back to me.

**When I (Claude) need to see specific lines:**

```bash
cat ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/path/to/file | grep -A 20 "searchTerm"
```

**When you need to edit a file:**

```bash
code ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/path/to/file
```

I provide the full code block, you copy-paste into VS Code.

**When testing:**

```bash
cd ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo
npm run dev
```

**When checking database:**

```bash
cd ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/packages/back-nest
sqlite3 speedtyper-local.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM challenge WHERE id LIKE 'local-%';"
```

**When searching for files/content:**

```bash
find ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo -name "filename"
grep -r "searchterm" --include="*.tsx" ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/
```

### Key Principles:

1.  ‚úÖ **Always use full absolute paths** from home directory
2.  ‚úÖ **I provide `code` commands**, not `nano` (you prefer VS Code)
3.  ‚úÖ **I give you full code blocks to copy-paste**, not diffs
4.  ‚úÖ **You only upload specific files** when I ask (not entire codebase)
5.  ‚úÖ **Terminal-based workflow** (cat, grep, code, npm) - fast and efficient
