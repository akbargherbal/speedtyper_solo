# Session 25 Summary: Configurable Keyboard Shortcuts

**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Duration:** ~45 minutes  
**Current Status:** Tier 1 Feature "Configurable Keyboard Shortcuts" - 100% Complete

---

## What We Accomplished This Session

- **Assessed Current Keyboard Functionality:** We reviewed the existing `useKeyMap.ts` hook and identified its limitations (no modifier key support, single-key focus).
- **Designed Browser-Safe Shortcuts:** After discussing browser conflicts (Ctrl+R, Ctrl+L), we agreed on a minimal, safe approach using Enter, Tab, and Alt+Arrow keys.
- **Enhanced useKeyMap Hook:** We added support for modifier keys (Alt, Ctrl, Shift) with proper isolation to prevent unwanted combinations.
- **Implemented Enter Key Navigation:** Added "Press Enter to continue" functionality on the results page for seamless workflow.
- **Implemented Language Cycling:** Added Alt+Left/Right arrow keys to cycle through available languages with visual toast notifications.
- **Added Visual Hints:** Displayed keyboard shortcut reminders on the results page to improve discoverability.

## Files Modified This Session

### 1. `packages/webapp-next/hooks/useKeyMap.ts`

**Path:** `~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/packages/webapp-next/hooks/useKeyMap.ts`

**Changes:**

- Added `ArrowLeft` and `ArrowRight` to the `Keys` enum
- Added new options interface: `UseKeyMapOptions` with fields for `requireAlt`, `requireCtrl`, `requireShift`
- Enhanced the keydown handler to check for modifier key requirements
- Added logic to prevent modifier key combinations (e.g., Alt+Ctrl+Arrow won't trigger Alt+Arrow shortcuts)
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing functionality

**Status:** COMPLETE

### 2. `packages/webapp-next/pages/index.tsx`

**Path:** `~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/packages/webapp-next/pages/index.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Added language fetching via `useSWR` to get available languages list
- Created `cycleLanguage` helper function to handle next/previous language selection
- Added `useKeyMap` hook for Enter key (results page only)
- Added `useKeyMap` hooks for Alt+Arrow keys (language cycling)
- Integrated toast notifications to show "Switched to [Language]" feedback
- Added visual keyboard shortcut hints below results container
- Imported necessary dependencies: `toast`, `useSWR`, `getExperimentalServerUrl`, `setLanguage`, `LanguageDTO`

**Status:** COMPLETE

## Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ Enter Key - Start Next Race

- **When:** Results page only
- **Action:** Starts a new race with the current language
- **Throttle:** 1 second
- **Visual Hint:** "Press Enter or Tab to continue"

### ‚úÖ Alt + Right Arrow - Next Language

- **When:** Anytime (except when modal is open)
- **Action:** Cycles to the next language in the alphabetically sorted list
- **Behavior:** Wraps around (last ‚Üí first)
- **Throttle:** 1 second
- **Feedback:** Toast notification showing new language name

### ‚úÖ Alt + Left Arrow - Previous Language

- **When:** Anytime (except when modal is open)
- **Action:** Cycles to the previous language in the list
- **Behavior:** Wraps around (first ‚Üí last)
- **Throttle:** 1 second
- **Feedback:** Toast notification showing new language name

### ‚úÖ Tab Key - Next Snippet (Existing)

- **When:** Anytime (except when modal is open)
- **Action:** Loads a new random snippet in the current language
- **Throttle:** 2 seconds
- **Status:** Unchanged, preserved existing behavior

---

## Design Decisions Made

### 1. Browser Conflict Avoidance

**Decision:** Avoid Ctrl+R, Ctrl+L, and other browser-reserved shortcuts.  
**Reasoning:** These shortcuts are deeply integrated into browser behavior and difficult to override reliably. Using Alt+Arrow keys provides a safe, conflict-free alternative.

### 2. Escape Key Not Implemented

**Decision:** Do not add Escape as a "refresh snippet" shortcut.  
**Reasoning:** This would duplicate Tab functionality. Escape already works correctly to close modals (handled by the Overlay component). No additional behavior needed.

### 3. Alt Key for Language Switching

**Decision:** Use Alt+Arrow instead of number keys or search interface.  
**Reasoning:**

- Alt+Arrow is intuitive (directional navigation)
- Works with unlimited languages
- No memorization required
- Low implementation complexity
- Zero browser conflicts

### 4. Toast Notifications

**Decision:** Show temporary toast when language changes.  
**Reasoning:** Provides immediate visual feedback without cluttering the UI. Users confirm their action worked and know which language is now active.

### 5. Throttling

**Decision:** 1-2 second throttles on all shortcuts.  
**Reasoning:** Prevents accidental double-triggers and gives backend/frontend time to sync state changes.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Modifier Key Support in `useKeyMap`

The enhanced hook now supports:

- `requireAlt` - Key must be pressed with Alt
- `requireCtrl` - Key must be pressed with Ctrl
- `requireShift` - Key must be pressed with Shift
- **Exclusivity enforcement** - Alt+Ctrl+Key won't trigger an Alt+Key shortcut

### Language Cycling Algorithm

```typescript
// Next language
newIndex = (currentIndex + 1) % languages.length;

// Previous language
newIndex = (currentIndex - 1 + languages.length) % languages.length;
```

This ensures seamless wrapping in both directions.

### State Management

- Language selection triggers `setLanguage()` from settings store
- Automatically calls `game?.next()` to load snippet in new language
- Updates localStorage for persistence across sessions

---

## Testing Performed

### Manual Testing Scenarios (All Passed ‚úÖ)

1. ‚úÖ Complete race ‚Üí Press Enter ‚Üí New race starts
2. ‚úÖ Press Alt+Right Arrow ‚Üí Cycles to next language, shows toast, loads snippet
3. ‚úÖ Press Alt+Left Arrow ‚Üí Cycles to previous language
4. ‚úÖ Cycle through all languages ‚Üí Wraps correctly at boundaries
5. ‚úÖ Press Tab ‚Üí Loads new snippet (existing behavior preserved)
6. ‚úÖ Open settings modal ‚Üí Keyboard shortcuts disabled (correct)
7. ‚úÖ Close modal with Escape ‚Üí Works as expected

### Browser Compatibility

- Tested on Chrome/Edge (Chromium-based)
- Alt+Arrow keys work without conflicts
- No interference with browser shortcuts

## Current Blockers

None. Feature is complete and stable.

## Next Session Action Plan

**Priority 1:** Complete Enhanced User Feedback (v1.3.0 final task)

**Tasks:**

1. Add connection status indicator to navbar
   - Show "Connected" / "Reconnecting..." / "Disconnected"
   - Use existing `connection-store.ts` state
2. Improve empty database state message
   - Already partially handled by backend error handling (Session 24)
   - Add proactive check in language selector if needed

**Files to review:**

```bash
cat ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/packages/webapp-next/common/components/NewNavbar.tsx
cat ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/packages/webapp-next/modules/play2/state/connection-store.ts
```

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Connection status visible in navbar
- [ ] Clear messaging when no snippets available
- [ ] v1.3.0 marked as 100% complete in FEATURES.md

**Alternative:** If you prefer to move to bigger features, we can skip Enhanced User Feedback and begin Tier 2 (Progress Dashboard architecture).

## ü§ù Collaboration Protocol (Minimum Friction)

### Command Patterns We're Using:

**When I (Claude) need to see a file:**

```bash
cat ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/path/to/file
```

You copy-paste the output back to me.

**When I (Claude) need to see specific lines:**

```bash
cat ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/path/to/file | grep -A 20 "searchTerm"
```

**When you need to edit a file:**

```bash
code ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/path/to/file
```

I provide the full code block, you copy-paste into VS Code.

**When testing:**

```bash
cd ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo
npm run dev
```

**When checking database:**

```bash
cd ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/packages/back-nest
sqlite3 speedtyper-local.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM challenge WHERE id LIKE 'local-%';"
```

**When searching for files/content:**

```bash
find ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo -name "filename"
grep -r "searchterm" --include="*.tsx" ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/
```

**When checking line endings or hidden characters:**

```bash
head -1 file.js | od -c              # Show character codes
file file.js                          # Check file encoding
hexdump -C file.js | head -3         # Show hex dump
```

### Key Principles:

1.  ‚úÖ **Always use full absolute paths** from home directory
2.  ‚úÖ **I provide `code` commands**, not `nano` (you prefer VS Code)
3.  ‚úÖ **I give you full code blocks to copy-paste**, not diffs
4.  ‚úÖ **You only upload specific files** when I ask (not entire codebase)
5.  ‚úÖ **Terminal-based workflow** (cat, grep, code, npm) - fast and efficient
6.  ‚úÖ **Hex dumps for debugging** encoding/line ending issues
