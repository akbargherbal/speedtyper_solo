## Looking Ahead: Release 1.1.0+ Planning

**User's Vision for Future Enhancements:**

1. **Syntax Highlighting Improvements**

   - Current: 3-color system (gray/purple/red)
   - Goal: Language-aware keyword colorization (e.g., `return`, `this`, `def`)

2. **Tree-sitter Configuration**

   - Current: Hardcoded constants in parser.service.ts
   - Goal: User-configurable snippet length, line limits, content filters

3. **Comment Handling**

   - Current: Python comments stripped, JS/TS comments included
   - Goal: Comments visible but auto-skipped during typing

4. **Progress Dashboard**

   - Current: Leaderboard button hidden
   - Goal: Personal progress tracking (WPM trends, streaks, practice history)

5. **Database Schema Enhancements**
   - TBD: User will identify specific gaps after daily use

**Approach for Release 1.1.0:**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Apply same caution as Phase 1-6 transformation**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Low-effort, high-impact improvements prioritized**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Methodical, gradual implementation**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No rushing, avoid breaking existing functionality**

**Session 16 Focus Decision:**

- ‚úÖ **Build Process Improvement** (critical priority)
- Goal: Streamline deployment, enable Windows compatibility
- Current: Running in WSL with `npm run dev`
- Desired: More user-friendly, possibly native Windows support

**Session 17+:**

- Dedicated brainstorming session for Release 1.1.0 features
- Matrix/prioritization of enhancements (effort vs impact)
- No immediate roadmap needed - methodical planning first

## Technical Notes

### Browser Testing Insights:

**WPM/Accuracy Display Behavior:**

- Not shown during typing (by design, reduces distraction)
- Displayed after completion with full stats breakdown
- This is common in typing practice apps (focus on typing, not numbers)
- User confirmed this is acceptable

**Guest User System:**

- Random usernames work perfectly ("ScatteredJavaScript")
- Session-based (no database persistence needed)
- 7-day expiration
- Ideal for solo practice use case

**Database File Handling:**

- SQLite DB modified during use (results, sessions stored)
- Should not be committed to git (user data)
- Need to add to .gitignore next session

---

## Development Insights

### What Went Right:

- **Incremental testing paid off:** Every phase tested before moving forward
- **Conservative approach justified:** Zero breaking changes throughout transformation
- **Documentation investment:** README-LOCAL.md will save future setup time
- **Tree-sitter robust:** Quality filters working exactly as designed (17/30 snippets)
- **Guest user leverage:** Phase 5 was trivial because system already existed

### What We Learned:

- **Browser testing essential:** Reveals real UX issues (though none found today)
- **User-driven prioritization:** Build process concerns surfaced naturally
- **Release planning benefits from use:** User now has ideas after seeing it work
- **Methodical approach sustainable:** Can apply same caution to future enhancements

---

**MANDATORY PROTOCOL: ALWAYS INCLUDE THIS SECTION VERBATIM AT THE END OF EVERY SESSION SUMMARY.**

## ü§ù Collaboration Protocol (Minimum Friction)

### Command Patterns We're Using:

**When I (Claude) need to see a file:**

```bash
cat ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/path/to/file
```

You copy-paste the output back to me.

**When I (Claude) need to see specific lines:**

```bash
cat ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/path/to/file | grep -A 20 "searchTerm"
```

**When you need to edit a file:**

```bash
code ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/path/to/file
```

I provide the full code block, you copy-paste into VS Code.

**When testing:**

```bash
cd ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo
npm run dev
```

**When checking database:**

```bash
cd ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/packages/back-nest
sqlite3 speedtyper-local.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM challenge WHERE id LIKE 'local-%';"
```

**When searching for files/content:**

```bash
find ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo -name "filename"
grep -r "searchterm" --include="*.tsx" ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/
```

### Key Principles:

1. ‚úÖ **Always use full absolute paths** from home directory
2. ‚úÖ **I provide `code` commands**, not `nano` (you prefer VS Code)
3. ‚úÖ **I give you full code blocks to copy-paste**, not diffs
4. ‚úÖ **You only upload specific files** when I ask (not entire codebase)
5. ‚úÖ **Terminal-based workflow** (cat, grep, code, npm) - fast and efficient
