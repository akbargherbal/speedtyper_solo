Of course. Based on our interaction in Session 9, here is the breakdown of files we worked with.

### Files Modified This Session (6 files)

These are the files for which I provided `code` commands with new content to replace the old versions.

1.  **`packages/back-nest/src/races/services/race-events.service.ts`**
    *   This was the core change, where we removed all room-based broadcasting (`server.to().emit()`) and replaced it with direct socket emissions (`socket.emit()`).

2.  **`packages/back-nest/src/races/services/countdown.service.ts`**
    *   We modified the `countdown` function to accept the `socket` object so it knew which client to send the countdown events to.

3.  **`packages/back-nest/src/races/services/results-handler.service.ts`**
    *   We updated the `handleResult` function to accept the `socket` object, allowing it to pass the final race result to the correct client.

4.  **`packages/back-nest/src/races/services/add-keystroke.service.ts`**
    *   We modified this file to pass the `socket` object down into the `results-handler.service.ts`.

5.  **`packages/back-nest/src/races/race.gateway.ts`**
    *   We made a small change here to pass the `socket` object into the `countdown.service.ts`.

6.  **`packages/webapp-next/styles/globals.css`**
    *   We added a block of new CSS rules at the end of this file to hide the multiplayer UI elements.

### Files Reviewed (But Not Changed)

This is the list of files I asked you to show me using `cat` so I could understand the existing logic, but for which I did **not** provide any modifications.

1.  **`packages/back-nest/src/races/services/race.service.ts`**
    *   I reviewed this file to understand the `isMultiplayer()` logic and how race members were handled, but we determined no changes were needed here.

*(Note: The six files that were modified were also reviewed first, but the file above is the only one we looked at that we didn't end up changing.)*
