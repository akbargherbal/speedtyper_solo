## What We Accomplished This Session

This session focused on **strategic planning and documentation optimization** following the completion of an independent feasibility report.

### 1. Feasibility Report Review & Analysis

**Consultant's Report Reviewed:**

- Evaluated all proposed features (3.1-3.4) for v1.4.0-v1.6.0
- Assessed implementation complexity, risk levels, and sequencing
- Identified critical unknowns requiring investigation
- Provided detailed technical approaches for each feature

**Key Findings Validated:**

- ‚úÖ Feature 3.1 (Stable User Identity): Green light, low risk, foundational requirement
- ‚úÖ Feature 3.2 (Progress Dashboard): Green light, depends on 3.1
- üü° Feature 3.3A (Character Skipping): Yellow, moderate complexity, prove architecture first
- üü° Feature 3.3B (AST-Based Skipping): Yellow, high complexity, build on 3.3A
- üî¥ Feature 3.4 (Syntax Highlighting): Red, requires major rework, user validation critical

### 2. Created Comprehensive Phased Implementation Plan

**Deliverable:** `Phased Implementation Plan (v1.4.0-v1.6.0)`

**Structure:**

- **Version Milestones:** Clear breakdown of v1.4.0 ‚Üí v1.6.0 with durations and rollback points
- **Safety-First Approach:** Each version can roll back to previous stable state
- **Phase Gates:** Pre-implementation investigations, incremental testing, documentation
- **Risk Mitigation:** Specific strategies for each feature's primary risks

**Key Characteristics:**

- 11-16 week total timeline (flexible based on real progress)
- Each version divided into Phase 0 (investigation) ‚Üí Phase 1-3 (implementation) ‚Üí Phase 4 (release)
- Feature toggles included for high-risk additions
- Performance gates (rollback if degradation detected)
- Database compatibility checks between versions

**Critical Safety Mechanisms:**

- Git tags at each milestone
- Smoke test checklists before releases
- Explicit rollback procedures documented
- Database migration scripts with backup strategies

### 3. Documentation Ecosystem Optimization

**Problem Identified:** Sharing 8 documents per session consumed ~45,000 tokens, leaving limited room for actual code work.

**Solution Implemented:** Document consolidation and retirement strategy

**Created New Consolidated Document:** `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` (~3,000 tokens)

**Replaces:**

- ~~PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md~~ (6,000 tokens)
- ~~ARCHITECTURE.md~~ (12,000 tokens) - Now on-demand only
- ~~FEATURES.md~~ (4,000 tokens) - Now on-demand only

**Retired Documents (Moved to Archive):**

- ~~tree.txt~~ (2,500 tokens) - Repository structure stable, rarely needed
- ~~feasibility_report.md~~ (8,000 tokens) - One-time planning doc, recommendations extracted
- ~~speedtyper_plan.md~~ (6,000 tokens) - Original 7-day plan, superseded by Phased Plan

**New Session Document Set:**

1. Session Summary (~2,000 tokens)
2. PROJECT_CONTEXT.md (~3,000 tokens) - NEW consolidated reference
3. Phased Implementation Plan - Current Phase Only (~8,000 tokens)

**Total Session Overhead:** ~13,000 tokens (down from ~45,000)  
**Token Savings:** **32,000 tokens per session (71% reduction)**

## Key Decisions & Outcomes

### Strategic Roadmap Confirmed

- **v1.4.0:** Foundation layer (stable identity + dashboard) - 3-4 weeks
- **v1.5.0:** Character skipping (spaces) - 2-3 weeks
- **v1.5.1:** AST-based skipping (comments) - 2-3 weeks
- **v1.6.0:** Syntax highlighting - 4-6 weeks (ONLY if user validation succeeds)

### Feature Dependencies Clarified

- Feature 3.2 (Dashboard) absolutely requires 3.1 (Stable Identity)
- Feature 3.3B (AST Skipping) requires 3.3A (Basic Skipping) to prove architecture
- Feature 3.4 (Highlighting) requires user testing before implementation commitment

### Documentation Strategy Finalized

- Lean session template reduces token overhead by 71%
- Full architecture docs available on-demand when needed
- Phased plan will be trimmed to "current phase only" as work progresses

---

## Documents Produced This Session

### 1. `Phased Implementation Plan (v1.4.0-v1.6.0)`

**Purpose:** Comprehensive blueprint for next 11-16 weeks of development  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Usage:** Share "current phase only" version in future sessions

### 2. `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`

**Purpose:** Consolidated reference replacing 3 verbose documents  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Usage:** Share in every session (replaces PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md, acts as quick-reference for ARCHITECTURE.md/FEATURES.md)

---

## Known Issues & Bugs

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Bug Logged for v1.3.1: Smooth Caret Offset**

**Feature:** Smooth Line Caret Style  
**File:** `packages/webapp-next/modules/play2/components/SmoothCaret.tsx`

**Observed Behavior:**

- When using "Line (smooth)" caret style, caret visual position becomes desynchronized from actual character position after typing 1-2 lines of a multi-line snippet
- Caret appears "offset," making it difficult to track typing location
- Only affects "Line (smooth)" style; other caret styles work correctly

**Associated Symptom:**

- React Hydration Error sometimes observed after hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Suggests potential state mismatch between server and client render

**Recommendation:**

- **Option A:** Fix if straightforward (likely alignment calculation issue)
- **Option B:** Remove feature if complex (nice-to-have, not critical to core experience)

**Impact:** Low (users can switch to other caret styles)

**Status:** Logged, not yet triaged

---

## Next Session Action Plan

### Priority 1: Fix Smooth Caret Bug (v1.3.1)

**Investigation Steps:**

1. Request the SmoothCaret.tsx component:
   ```bash
   cat ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/packages/webapp-next/modules/play2/components/SmoothCaret.tsx
   ```
2. Review caret position calculation logic
3. Check if multi-line offset calculation is incorrect
4. Test fix or recommend removal

**Success Criteria:**

- Caret stays aligned with character position across multiple lines
- No React hydration errors
- OR: Feature cleanly removed with no side effects

### Priority 2: Finalize v1.3.0 & Create Git Tag

**Tasks:**

1. Complete smooth caret fix
2. Run complete smoke test checklist
3. Create git tag: `git tag v1.3.0`
4. Test rollback to v1.2.0 to verify safety net works
5. Update CHANGELOG.md with v1.3.0 notes

### Priority 3: Begin v1.4.0 Phase 0 (Investigation)

**If Time Permits:**

Run database investigation queries from feasibility report:

```bash
cd ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/packages/back-nest
sqlite3 speedtyper-local.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM result;"
sqlite3 speedtyper-local.db "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT userId) FROM result;"
sqlite3 speedtyper-local.db "SELECT userId, COUNT(*) as race_count FROM result GROUP BY userId ORDER BY race_count DESC LIMIT 5;"
```

This data will inform the data migration strategy for Feature 3.1 (Stable User Identity).

**Documents Retired:** 5 (tree.txt, feasibility report, original plan, plus 2 moved to on-demand)  
**Future Token Savings:** 32,000 tokens per session (71% reduction)  
**Strategic Value:** High (clear roadmap through v1.6.0, safety mechanisms in place)

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well:

- Independent feasibility report provided objective analysis
- Phased implementation plan captures all details from report and original 7-day plan
- Document consolidation dramatically reduces session overhead
- Safety-first approach (rollback points, phase gates) reduces risk

### Adjustments Made:

- Recognized that time estimates should account for LLM/human collaboration pace
- Prioritized token efficiency to maximize coding time in future sessions
- Established on-demand documentation pattern (full docs available when needed, not shared by default)

---

## Next Session Preparation

**Documents to Share:**

1. Session 27 Summary (this document)
2. PROJECT_CONTEXT.md (new consolidated reference)
3. Phased Implementation Plan - v1.3.1 Section Only (smooth caret bug fix)

**Total Token Budget:** ~5,000 tokens (leaves 185,000 for actual work!)

**First Action:** Request SmoothCaret.tsx component to begin bug investigation

## ü§ù Collaboration Protocol (Minimum Friction)

### Command Patterns We're Using:

**When I (Claude) need to see a file:**

```bash
cat ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/path/to/file
```

You copy-paste the output back to me.

**When I (Claude) need to see specific lines:**

```bash
cat ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/path/to/file | grep -A 20 "searchTerm"
```

**When you need to edit a file:**

```bash
code ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/path/to/file
```

I provide the full code block, you copy-paste into VS Code.

**When testing:**

```bash
cd ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo
npm run dev
```

**When checking database:**

```bash
cd ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/packages/back-nest
sqlite3 speedtyper-local.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM challenge WHERE id LIKE 'local-%';"
```

**When searching for files/content:**

```bash
find ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo -name "filename"
grep -r "searchterm" --include="*.tsx" ~/Jupyter_Notebooks/speedtyper_solo/speedtyper-solo/
```

**When checking line endings or hidden characters:**

```bash
head -1 file.js | od -c              # Show character codes
file file.js                          # Check file encoding
hexdump -C file.js | head -3         # Show hex dump
```

### Key Principles:

1.  ‚úÖ **Always use full absolute paths** from home directory
2.  ‚úÖ **I provide `code` commands**, not `nano` (you prefer VS Code)
3.  ‚úÖ **I give you full code blocks to copy-paste**, not diffs
4.  ‚úÖ **You only upload specific files** when I ask (not entire codebase)
5.  ‚úÖ **Terminal-based workflow** (cat, grep, code, npm) - fast and efficient
6.  ‚úÖ **Hex dumps for debugging** encoding/line ending issues
