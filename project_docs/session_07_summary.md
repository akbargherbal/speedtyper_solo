# Session 7 Summary: A Necessary Detour to Perfect Snippet Quality

**Date:** October 28, 2025
**Duration:** ~1.5 hours
**Current Status:** Phase 3 - TRULY COMPLETE! ‚úÖ The custom snippet system is now robust and high-quality.

## Session Context: A Critical Course Correction

At the end of Session 6, we had marked Phase 3 as "complete." The plan for this session was to begin Phase 4 (Multiplayer Removal). However, I made a crucial post-session observation that our solution was too aggressive. By removing `tree-sitter` parsing entirely, we had solved an import blocker but sacrificed the core user experience of practicing with focused, clean code snippets.

This session was therefore dedicated entirely to backtracking on that decision and implementing a far superior solution.

## What We Accomplished This Session

### ‚úÖ Reinstated and Enhanced Tree-Sitter Parsing

Instead of discarding the parser, we brought it back and made it significantly more intelligent and flexible.

1.  **Restored `ParserService`:** We reverted the changes in `local-import-runner.ts` to use the `tree-sitter` parser again for intelligent snippet extraction.
2.  **Implemented "Goldilocks" Filters:** The original, overly-strict filters were relaxed to accept more realistic code snippets while still filtering out noise.
    - `MAX_NODE_LENGTH`: 300 ‚Üí **800 chars**
    - `MAX_NUM_LINES`: 11 ‚Üí **25 lines**
    - `MAX_LINE_LENGTH`: 55 ‚Üí **100 chars**
3.  **‚ú® NEW FEATURE: Automatic Code Cleaning:** We added new logic to the parser that automatically strips comments, docstrings (for Python), and collapses excessive blank lines. The result is pure, typeable code, just as I wanted.
4.  **Expanded Node Support:** Added `lexical_declaration` and `arrow_function` to better support modern JavaScript/TypeScript.

### ‚úÖ Solved Parser Language Bug

Our first import attempt failed with an `Error getting parser for language='javascript'`. We diagnosed that the parser's internal keys (e.g., "js", "py") did not match the display names we were using ("javascript", "python").

**Fix:** We created two separate mapping functions to distinguish between the internal parser key and the display name for the UI, resolving all import errors.

**Result:** The import command now successfully processes all 30 files, extracting multiple high-quality, cleaned snippets from each. A total of **58 snippets** were imported.

## Current Project Status (As of End of Session 7)

### üéØ Phase 3 Status: TRULY COMPLETE (100%)

The custom snippets system is now finalized. It successfully imports local code, intelligently extracts meaningful snippets, and cleans them for a premium practice experience.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues (Carry-over from Session 6)

The following UI issues, identified in Session 6, are still pending and are the top priority for Phase 4:

- **Issue #1: Can't Choose Language/Snippet:** The language selector is hidden behind multiplayer logic (`isOwner` flag).
- **Issue #2: Viewport Scrolling Problem:** Longer snippets cause disruptive scrolling behavior during typing.

### ü§ù Our Collaboration Workflow

We have established an efficient protocol for our collaboration. When you (the LLM) need to review a file on my local machine, you will provide me with a `cat` command to run. This allows me to stay in the terminal and simply copy-paste the output.

When you (the LLM) return a response with code, you will provide it as a simple code block. I will then copy/paste it into the relevant file.

## Next Session Action Plan: **Resume Phase 4 - Multiplayer Removal & Documentation**

Now that the snippet quality is excellent, we can proceed with the plan originally laid out at the end of Session 6, with the addition of creating a project README.

### **Session Goal:** Make speedtyper.dev truly solo by tackling UI issues, removing backend multiplayer logic, and documenting the setup.

**Priorities for Next Session:**

1.  **Fix Language Selection (Issue #1):** Investigate `game-store.ts` to make the guest user the "owner" in solo mode, revealing the language selector.
2.  **Backend Multiplayer Removal:** Modify `race.gateway.ts` to stub out broadcasting logic.
3.  **Hide Multiplayer UI Elements:** Clean up the frontend by hiding irrelevant buttons and links.
4.  **(If Time Permits) Create Project README:** Create a `README.md` file in the project root that includes:
    - Project title ("Speedtyper Solo").
    - A "Quick Start" guide (clone, install, add snippets, `npm run dev`).
    - A brief explanation of the local snippet system.
5.  **(If Time Permits) Fix Viewport Scrolling (Issue #2):** Investigate `CodeArea.tsx` and implement a smooth scroll-into-view for the active line.

**End of Session 7**

This was an incredibly productive session. By pausing and addressing the quality issue, we've built a feature that is vastly superior to our initial solution. The project is now on a much stronger foundation. We are fully prepared to dive into Phase 4 and make the app a polished, solo-focused tool.
